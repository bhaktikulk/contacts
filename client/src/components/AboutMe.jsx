      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Crafting an engaging and informative biography for your portfolio’s ‘About Me’ page is an essential step in showcasing your artistic skills and experiences. This section of your website allows you to introduce yourself, highlight your expertise, and–when appropriate for your brand and clientele–connect with potential clients or employers on a more personal level.

Writing about yourself might not come naturally to you–and you’re far from alone in that. We’ve put together these tips to ease you into the process and help you create a compelling narrative that captures your unique story and professional journey. If you’re more of a video person, you can also watch our condensed About Me page tips here. 
      </p>
      <p>1.Introduce yourself</p>
      <p>Begin your biography by introducing yourself, just like how you’d open a conversation with a new friend. Share your name, your area of expertise, and a brief overview of who you are and what you do. This opening paragraph should grab the reader’s attention and give them a sense of your personality and background. Location can be very important for some clients and galleries. There’s no need to include your full address, but including the city where you’re based makes it easier for potential clients to know whether you fit their needs. </p>
      <p>2. Highlight your expertise and achievements</p>
      <p>Select the experiences and accomplishments you’re most proud of or excited about to highlight in your biography. Remember to keep your biography concise and focused, rather than trying to include every detail. Highlight any notable projects, awards, or recognitions you have received that demonstrate your expertise and the impact of your work.</p>
